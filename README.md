# 100 days of Web Development Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code-web-development-bootcamp/

In this repo I will be pushing each challenge that I complete from the 100 days of web development course. To see what I learn and track how I progress through the class. 
Some of this information is going to be a review from what I learned in my Code Platoon Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp. Although review never hurts and sticking to the basics is a way that I will ensure that I build a stronger foundation as I continue to learn.
